# **HTML, CSS, and Github: Code Refactoring**

## Purpose of the Homework:
A website's code is given that requires for changes to be made that would not change the webite's layout, formatting, and/or behavior. Essentially, it asks to clean the code. We remove and modify unnecessary elements which makes it easier for those who wants to view the code.

## Changes/Edits That Were Made:

* Changed the title in the HTML file from "website" to "Horiseon Page"
* Added HTML semantics (Header, Figure, Section, Aside, and Footer)
* Replaced "div" to "nav" in the header in both HTML and CSS
	* Also changed the header in the CSS since it is no longer a class
* Added alt attribute to the Figure image ("work-collab")
* Added alt attributes to the Section images ("search", "online", "marketing")
* Added alt attributes to the Aside images ("lead", "brand", "cost")
* Switched the "p" from line 49 to line 58 in the CSS file as it follows with the order of the semantic structure in HTML.
* Switched (.)content class from line 72 to line 62 in the CSS file as it follows with the order of the semantic structure in HTML.
* Moved the (.)content & (.)benefits children with its parent in the CSS file
	* The (.)content & (.)benefits class is structured in the same order for both HTML and CSS
* Grouped the (.)content's & (.) benefits' div classes, images, and headers in the CSS file
